This folder contains the implementation of a CKY parser. The parser uses a context free grammar to parse English sentences taken from a portion of the ATIS corpus.

To run the parser:
./hw3_parser.sh cfg_grammar test_sentences output_file

cfg_grammar: a context free grammar that follows Chomsky normal form
test_sentences: Sentences that you would like to have parsed; one per line
output_file: The result of the parse - includes all possible parses for each sentence and the final train and test accuracy.
